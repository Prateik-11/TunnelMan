# TunnelMan
Game developed as the final project of CS32 at UCLA.

StudentWorld.h, StudentWorld.cpp, Actor.h, and Actor.cpp were made by me. The rest of the files were provided.


In TunnelMan, the player has to dig underground tunnels through an oil field looking
for oil. After the player has gathered all available oil within a particular field, the level
is completed and the player advances to a new, more difficult oil field.
